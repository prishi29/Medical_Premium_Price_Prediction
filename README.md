# Medical Premium Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting yearly medical premium prices using regression analysis, with the aim of providing insights into how different factors influence premium costs. Additionally, we have grouped premium prices into five distinct categories and applied classification techniques to categorize these costs, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Project Overview

Medical premium prices are influenced by a multitude of variables, including age, gender, medical history, and more. To gain insights into the factors driving premium costs, we conducted a regression analysis. Our goal was to create predictive models that could estimate yearly medical premium prices based on these variables.

## Regression Analysis

Our regression analysis involved identifying the most relevant factors affecting premium prices and building predictive models to estimate these costs. This step is crucial for both insurers and policyholders to make informed decisions.

## Categorization of Premium Prices

In addition to predicting specific premium prices, we recognized the value of categorizing premiums into distinct groups. To achieve this, we grouped premium prices into five categories based on the price range and applied classification techniques. This allows for a broader understanding of the cost distribution, aiding in decision-making and policy selection.
